        <p>NuGet Stats was a fun little experiment I started to see what would happen if I downloaded <em>the entire</em> NuGet directory and then ran some data mining and visualizations on it. The results were neat. Unfortunately, it turns out that downloading and analyzing the main NuGet feed takes a lot of database space, a lot of processor cycles, and a lot of time to maintain. There are just too many edge cases. I learned a lot in the process of building NuGet Stats, but it's time to let it go (for now). I may bring it back as a dedicated web application at some point in the future, but for now I'm going to dedicate my time to other projects.</p>
