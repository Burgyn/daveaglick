    <p>If you've read the book @Bootstrap.Link("High Fidelity", "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285092.High_Fidelity") then you know that the protagonist, Rob, is obsessed with making lists of things. I can relate. There are a ton of great tools and resources available to software developers and putting stuff in lists helps make sense of it all. To that end, I've curated a few lists of things that I like and will periodically update them as my likes change.</p>
