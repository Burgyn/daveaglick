<p>This is a short post about using <a href="https://cakebuild.net">Cake</a> to publish packages from <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines">Azure Pipelines</a> to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts">Azure Artifacts</a> that took me the better part of a day to figure out. For completness I'll walk through my entire process but if you just want to know how to do it, skip to the end.</p>
<p>I've been a very happy user of <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://www.myget.org/">MyGet</a> for my open source work. At my day job we use an on-premesis <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> server which also sends packages to MyGet. In both cases, publishing a package from a Cake build script is relativly straightforward and basically involves getting an API key from MyGet and feeding that to the Cake <a href="https://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Common.Tools.NuGet/NuGetAliases/08163C34"><code>NuGetPush</code></a> alias. Now that I'm investigating moving some of the workloads at my day job to <a href="https://dev.azure.com/">Azure DevOps services</a>, I'm finding this simple task isn't so straightforward.</p>
<h1 id="personal-access-token">Personal Access Token</h1>
<p>My first attempt was to get an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate">Azure DevOps personal access token</a> with package management grants and feed that to the <code>NuGetPush</code> Cake alias, just like I was used to doing with MyGet. That resulted in error messages that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Unable to load the service index for source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/xyz/_packaging/xyz/nuget/v3/index.json.
Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized).
</code></pre>
<p>After that, I took the most resonable first troubleshooting step...and ranted on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good grief. I always feel so dumb when trying to do anything with Azure. Can&#39;t figure out how to push a package from Azure Pipelines to Azure Artifacts using an API key. And no, I don&#39;t want to setup and use a special credential provider. This was so easy with AppVeyor/MyGet.</p>&mdash; Dave Glick (&#64;daveaglick) <a href="https://twitter.com/daveaglick/status/1059801965415272448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunatly the answer wasn't what I wanted to see:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for the feedback. There are some under-the-hood reasons why we don&#39;t support apikey. But, Azure Pipelines has a &quot;NuGet&quot; task (or &quot;.NET Core&quot; if you prefer) that will automatically authenticate to Azure Artifacts for both push and restore.</p>&mdash; Alex Mullans (&#64;alexmullans) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmullans/status/1059811282851905536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>It turns out that you can't use a personal access token as an API key to publish packages to Azure Artifacts.</p>
<h1 id="credential-provider">Credential Provider</h1>
<p>My next step was to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-credprovider">VSTS Credential Provider</a>. It's essentially <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/get-started-nuget#publish-a-package">the only documented way of publishing a package</a>. Thankfully the credential provider is on NuGet as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.NuGet.CredentialProvider">Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.NuGet.CredentialProvider</a> so you can add it as a tool to your Cake script:</p>
<pre><code>#tool &quot;nuget:?package=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.NuGet.CredentialProvider&amp;version=0.37.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Once you've installed it, you need to tell NuGet where to find it. Fortunatly there's an environment variable called <code>NUGET_CREDENTIALPROVIDERS_PATH</code> that NuGet uses to find credential providers. We can set it from our Cake script like this:</p>
<pre><code>var credentialProviderPath = GetFiles(&quot;**/CredentialProvider.VSS.exe&quot;).First().FullPath;
Information(&quot;Setting NUGET_CREDENTIALPROVIDERS_PATH to &quot; + credentialProviderPath);
System.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;NUGET_CREDENTIALPROVIDERS_PATH&quot;, credentialProviderPath, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Machine);
</code></pre>
<p>Less fortunatly, this doesn't seem to work at all. In fact, I couldn't get NuGet to recognize the <code>NUGET_CREDENTIALPROVIDERS_PATH</code> environment variable no matter how it was set (and I tried everything, including using the <code>NuGetPushSettings.EnvironmentVariables</code> property). That led to just copying the credential provider alongside <code>nuget.exe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var credentialProviderPath = GetFiles(&quot;**/CredentialProvider.VSS.exe&quot;).First().FullPath;
var nugetPath = GetFiles(&quot;**/nuget.exe&quot;).First().GetDirectory();
CopyFiles(new [] { credentialProviderPath }, nugetPath);
</code></pre>
<p>This allowed NuGet to find the credential provider, but at that point I couldn't figure out how to automatically get it to authenticate:</p>
<pre><code>CredentialProvider.VSS: Getting new credentials for source:https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/xyz/_packaging/xyz/nuget/v3/index.json, scope:vso.packaging_write vso.drop_write
CredentialProvider.VSS: Couldn't get an authentication token for https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/xyz/_packaging/xyz/nuget/v3/index.json.
Unable to load the service index for source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/xyz/_packaging/xyz/nuget/v3/index.json.
Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized).
</code></pre>
<p>Most of the documentation talks about using the credential provider interactivly, either by displaying a UI or prompting for credentials on the command line. I'm sure there's a way to make this work from a script, but I was getting pretty frustrated with the credential provider at this point.</p>
<h1 id="system.accesstoken">System.AccessToken</h1>
<p>I was tipped off by my Cake buddies to some blog posts from <a href="https://kevsoft.net/2018/08/06/configuring-private-vsts-nuget-feeds-with-cake.html">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="https://tech.trailmax.info/2017/01/publish-to-vsts-nuget-feed-from-cakebuild/">Max Vasilyev</a> about using OAuth tokens for publishing to VSTS. It turns out Azure Pipelines exposes a special pipeline variable named <code>System.AccessToken</code> that contains an OAuth key for the VSTS/Azure DevOps REST API. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables#systemaccesstoken">You have to manually activate it from your YAML file</a>:</p>
<pre><code>variables:
  SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
</code></pre>
<p>That <em>should</em> provide access to a <code>SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN</code> environment variable from inside your scripts, but...wait for it...:</p>
<pre><code>Could not resolve SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN
</code></pre>
<p>Bet you saw that coming. For some reason, I couldn't figure out how to set the enviornment variable globally, but I was able to set it at the script level:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - script: build -target Publish
   env:
     SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
</code></pre>
<p>Once that's done, you can register a NuGet feed from inside your Cake script using the access token and then use it when publishing a package. Here's my working package publishing task inside my Cake script:</p>
<pre><code>Task(&quot;Publish&quot;)
    .IsDependentOn(&quot;Pack&quot;)
    .WithCriteria(() =&gt; isRunningOnBuildServer)
    .Does(() =&gt;
    {
        // Get the access token
        var accessToken = EnvironmentVariable(&quot;SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN&quot;);
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(accessToken))
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Could not resolve SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN.&quot;);
        }

        // Add the authenticated feed source
        NuGetAddSource(
            &quot;VSTS&quot;,
            &quot;https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/xyz/_packaging/xyz/nuget/v3/index.json&quot;,
            new NuGetSourcesSettings
            {
                UserName = &quot;VSTS&quot;,
                Password = accessToken
            });

        foreach (var nupkg in GetFiles(buildDir.Path.FullPath + &quot;/*.nupkg&quot;))
        {
            NuGetPush(nupkg, new NuGetPushSettings 
            {
                Source = &quot;VSTS&quot;,
                ApiKey = &quot;VSTS&quot;
            });
        }
    });
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of &quot;VSTS&quot; for <code>UserName</code> and <code>ApiKey</code>. That's basically a dummy value - NuGet requires <em>something</em> for those properties but it doesn't really care what. The important part is that the <code>SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN</code> environment variable is being used as the <code>Password</code> for the <code>NuGetSourcesSettings</code>, and that the name of the new source matches the <code>Source</code> property in the <code>NuGetPushSettings</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post saves you a bit of time. Once it's set up it appears to work well, but discovering the &quot;right way&quot; of doing this took longer than it should have (if this even is the right way).</p>
